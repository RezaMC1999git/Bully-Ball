1.DO NOT change the location of AndroidManifest.xml and PhotoCropper.jar. They must be placed in the Asset/Plugins/Android path. Otherwise, the plug-in might not run.
2.The source code for the Android section is in source_code.zip. I use Android Studio to export the .arr, and pick the classes.jar from the .aar.(REMINDER: DO NOT pick the classes.jar from the lib dictionary) If you do not know how to export .jar, a video (https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Qt4y1a7aW?from=search&seid=8004011218970423000&spm_id_from=333.337.0.0) is highly recommended. This video is only available in Chinese.
3.This plugin works fine on Unity 2019.4.21f1c1. Unity 2019.4.21f1c1 and later versions should also work properly. It also works fine on most Android phones, including Huawei's and Xiaomi's(MIUI).
